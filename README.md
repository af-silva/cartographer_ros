=========================================================================
Cartographer ROS Integration without the need to use catkin_make_isolated
=========================================================================


All the credits to the Google team and contributors behind this project.
This branch is intended to be used directly in any ROS workspace without 
the need to compile using catkin_make_isolated and assuming that the 
libraries Cartographer and Ceres are pre-installed in the system, removing
the need to compile every time.
